### ✨ Explanation

I've made this project with the main purpose of learn new skills about JavaScript, CSS (mostly Grid and Flex Layout) and improve my knowledge about consuming APIs.

### 🎨 Customization and features

You can customice the app with the following features:

-   Easy configuration file `config.js`.
-   Custom name.
-   Custom greetings based on the current time.
-   Modular JS files for a better approach to the app.

```js
// GENERAL
name: 'Jorge',

// GREETINGS
greetingMorning: 'Good morning',
greetingAfternoon: 'Good afternoon',
greetingEvening: 'Good evening',
greetingNight: 'Good night'
```
